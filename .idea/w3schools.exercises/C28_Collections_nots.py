# Python Collections (Arrays)
# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.

# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.

# Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable and unindexed.
# Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.No duplicate members.

# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
# (As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.)
