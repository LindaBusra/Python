#Python Arithmetic Operators
# addition: +, substraction: -, division: /, multiplication: *,
# modulus: %, Exponentiation: **, 	Floor division: //

#The precedence order is () --> ** --> *,  /,  //,  %  --> +,  -

#** Exponentiation x**y
x=2
y=5
print(x**y)    #same as 2^5

#Floor division  // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number
x=15
y=2
